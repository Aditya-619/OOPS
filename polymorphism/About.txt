Polymorphism:

* The word "Polymorphism" means having many forms.
* We can define Polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
* It means that a call to a member funvtion will cause a different function to be executed
  depending on the type of object that invokes the function.

A real life example of Polymorphism:

A women is a mother when she is at home, when she is at office she is an employee, 
when she is at mall she is a customer. so, the same women act different in different scenario.
This is called Polymorphism (having many forms).

There are two types of Polymorphism:

1) Compiletime Polymorphism
   eg. Function overloading (same name different number of parameters)

2) Runtime Polymorphism
   eg. Virtual Function, Function Overriding
